The data directory contains:
- the raw transition rates in High Salt: Final_merged_data_withNaCl.txt
- fertility data from the Cemee: fertility.rda (from Noble et al. 2017)
- an additional raw traits measured in the movies that include body size: merged_data_means.txt

The Rcode directory contains all code to reproduce the analysis.

We also included txt output files showing the different computed G/M matrices (txt directory) and the auto-correlation plots from the MCMCglmm models.
RData files produced by the code are too large and will be stored on Dryad upon publication.
